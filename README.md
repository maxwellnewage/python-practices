# Python Practices
This repository was created with the purpose of learning by practicing through different exercises outlined in each of the scripts. 
If you're interested in learning Python from scratch, 
I recommend you check out my courses (Spanish lang):
- [Web Development with Python and Django](https://www.udemy.com/course/desarrollo-de-sitios-web-con-python-3-con-django/?referralCode=A491B0944C634BFAA48C) [[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp7PPjAxisAICL8_g0lmC3thJvHW5Hbe3)]
- [Python from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp7PPjAxisALk2zFlMx3DzT1MytOEGUmF)

I also have a podcast where I talk about development, especially in Python. 
It's called "En CÃ³digo," and you can find it on [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/maxi-burgos9).

## Getting Started
Create and activate the virtual environment:

> python -m venv venv

> .\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Flake8
Flake8 has been implemented in the project, which can be run using this command:
> flake8 --exclude=venv

The virtual environment is excluded to focus only on the current project.
Possible warnings reported by Flake8:
> .\level_beginner\filtrar_palabras.py:2:40: W291 trailing whitespace

> .\level_advance\regex\is_phone_number.py:35:80: E501 line too long (86 > 79 characters)

> .\level_advance\regex\detect_start_end_str.py:28:44: W292 no newline at end of file

At the moment, all warnings have been resolved, but if new ones are detected, please open an issue. If you want to know more about it, I leave you an [article](https://dev.to/maxwellnewage/diario-de-python-17-un-paseo-por-flake8-33do) where I talk about this linter.
